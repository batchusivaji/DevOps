# Terraform

``` Use Infrastructure as Code to provision and manage any cloud,infrastructure, or service ```

## Deliver infrastructure as code with Terraform

#### Write declarative configuration files
* Collaborate and share configurations0
* Evolve and version your infrastructure
* Automate provisioning

    Define infrastructure as code to manage the full lifecycle â€” create new resources, manage existing ones, and destroy those no longer needed.

#### Plan and predict changes
* Clearly mapped resource dependencies
* Separation of plan and apply
* Consistent, repeatable workflow

    Terraform provides an elegant user experience for operators to safely and predictably make changes to infrastructure.

#### Create reproducible infrastructure
* Reproducible production, staging, and development environments
* Shared modules for common infrastructure patterns
* Combine multiple providers consistently
    
    Terraform makes it easy to re-use configurations for similar infrastructure, helping you avoid mistakes and save time.
